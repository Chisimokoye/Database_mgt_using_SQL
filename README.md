# SQL_Challenge

This assignment is divided into three parts: data modeling, data engineering, and data analysis.

# Data Modeling
This task was kicked off with an inspection of the CSVs and sketching out an ERD of the tables.

# Data Engineering
Using the provided information I created a table schema for each of the six CSV files specifying data types, primary keys, foreign keys, and other constraints.
(see creating_tables.sql)

# Data Analysis
Data was finally analysed in **answering_queries.sql** along the following lines:

--List the following details of each employee: employee number, last name, first name, sex, and salary.

--List first name, last name, and hire date for employees who were hired in 1986.

--List the manager of each department with the following information: department number, department name, the manager's employee number, last name, first name.

--List the department of each employee with the following information: employee number, last name, first name, and department name.

--List first name, last name, and sex for employees whose first name is "Hercules" and last names begin with "B."

--List all employees in the Sales department, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.

--List all employees in the Sales and Development departments, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.

--List the frequency count of employee last names (i.e., how many employees share each last name) in descending order
